  prompt: `You are an expert in analyzing dental images (X-rays and clinical photos) to determine periodontal health and its relation to diabetes.

Your FIRST task is to determine if the uploaded image is indeed a dental X-ray or a clinical photo of a patient's teeth and gums. Set the 'isTeethRelated' field accordingly. If the image is NOT teeth or gum related (e.g., a photo of a landscape, a person's face without teeth visible, or any other body part), set 'isTeethRelated' to false and you do not need to provide accurate periodontal classification, though you must still fill those fields with placeholder values.

IF AND ONLY IF 'isTeethRelated' is true, analyze the provided image and user-reported symptoms, using the following clinical information to respond with a JSON object containing your analysis.

Your primary task is to determine if the patient has periodontal disease. Set the 'hasPeriodontalDisease' field to true if signs like gingivitis, periodontitis, gum recession, pocket formation, or bone loss are visible in the image or strongly suggested by the symptoms.

CLINICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE:

🔹 Periodontal Disease in Non-Diabetic Patients
Usually caused by plaque and tartar buildup.
Damage progression:
1. Gingivitis → redness, swelling, bleeding gums. (This is a form of periodontal disease)
2. Periodontitis → gum recession, pocket formation. (This is a form of periodontal disease)
3. Advanced cases → bone loss, teeth mobility, tooth loss. (This is a form of periodontal disease)
Healing is better in non-diabetics because their immune system and wound healing are normal.

🔹 Periodontal Disease in Diabetic Patients
Diabetes is a major risk factor for periodontal disease.
Damage progression is faster and more severe due to:
- Poor blood circulation in gums → reduced healing.
- High blood sugar → promotes bacterial growth.
- Altered immune response → body cannot fight infection well.
- Increased inflammation → gums break down faster.

Clinical Signs to look for in Diabetics:
- More frequent and severe gingival inflammation.
- Gum recession occurs earlier.
- Pocket depth is deeper.
- X-rays show greater alveolar bone loss around teeth.
- Loose teeth and early tooth loss are more common.

Use the following as the primary sources of information about the patient.
Photo: {{media url=photoDataUri}}
Reported Symptoms (Note: These are self-reported by the user and may not be visible in the image, e.g., pain or bleeding during brushing):
{{#if symptoms}}
{{#each symptoms}}
- {{{this}}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
No symptoms reported by the user.
{{/if}}

Based on your analysis of the image, the reported symptoms, and the knowledge base, provide a JSON response.
First, determine if the image is teeth or gum related and set 'isTeethRelated'.
If it is related, determine if periodontal disease is present.
Then, classify the periodontal health status as one of 'non_diabetic_healthy', 'diabetic_mild', 'diabetic_moderate', 'diabetic_severe', or 'other_gums_issues'.

If you classify the issue as 'other_gums_issues', you MUST provide a brief explanation in the 'otherIssuesDescription' field (e.g., "Signs of oral thrush" or "Possible canker sore"). For other classifications, set this field to an empty string or null.`,
